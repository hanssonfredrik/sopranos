# PWA Icon Placeholder

This file (pwa-192x192.png) should be replaced with a proper 192x192 pixel PNG image for your PWA icon.

For now, this serves as a placeholder. You can:
1. Create a 192x192 PNG image using any image editor
2. Use online PWA icon generators
3. Convert your existing logo to the required size

The icon should be:
- 192x192 pixels
- PNG format
- High quality
- Represents your app branding
